                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p> Hello, my name is Cory Headrick. I am currently a senior pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the University of Tennessee. You may have noticed that I already have another Bachelor's degree in Audiology and Speech
                        Pathology. While I still value the lessons that degree has taught me, I realized during my doctorate program that this was not going to make me happy. I then had to make the difficult decision to either continue pursuing my doctorate
                        in Audiology for another 4 years, or make a radical change in my life. As is evident by this website that I've coded from scratch, I chose the latter.
                    </p>
                    <p> I have always been drawn to technology, seeing the virtual world as a vast uncharted frontier waiting to be explored. The level of freedom and creativity afforded to me through a knowledge of programming and computer architecture is
                        invaluable in my eyes. I am a life-long learner, and am always seeking to better my skills and understanding. I hope to find a career where I can confront complex problems with creativity and determination, and create programs
                        that can better peoples' lives and propel humanity forward.
                    </p>
