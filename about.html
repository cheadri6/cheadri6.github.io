                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p> Hello, my name is Cory Headrick. I graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's in computer science from the University of Tennessee. I have a great interest in application development as well as video game development. I like to
                        bring a unique perspective to any project I work on while trying to maximize efficiency and readability.
                    </p>
                    <p> I have always been drawn to technology, seeing the virtual world as a vast uncharted frontier waiting to be explored. The level of freedom and creativity afforded to me through a knowledge of programming and computer architecture is
                        invaluable in my eyes. I am a life-long learner, and am always seeking to better my skills and understanding. I hope to find a career where I can confront complex problems with creativity and determination, and create programs
                        that can better peoples' lives and propel humanity forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of programming, I try to maintain a well-rounded selection of interests. On a sunny day, I like to jog, go kayaking, or camping, or spend time with my wife and our two dogs in the park. I also enjoy playing all kinds of video games, reading, and
                        creative writing. My dream is to one day create a narrative-driven video game using the stories that I have written.
                    </p>
